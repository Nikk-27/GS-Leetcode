'''
TC: of the lowestCommonAncestor function is O(h), where 
â„Ž is the height of the binary search tree. In the worst case, this could be \U0001d442(\U0001d441) for a skewed tree, where \U0001d441 is the number of nodes. However, for a balanced tree, it would be \U0001d442(logN).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) since the solution only uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like cur
